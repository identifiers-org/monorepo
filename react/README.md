# These are react components used in identifiers.org

Identifiers.org has two main react frontends, the satellite SPA at http://identifiers.org and 
the registry SPA at https://registry.identifiers.org.

The `registry` subfolder has the React SPA for the registry pages.
The satellite SPA source is under the webservices folder.
All the React components have independent code bases.
We hope to separate common functionality into libraries in the future, 
that is why the `commons` and the `search-bar` are there.
